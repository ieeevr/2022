        Though the decision has been made to transform IEEE VR 2022 into an all-digital online conference experience, several members 
        of the IEEE VR community around the world have agreed to organise small meeting hubs for those able to travel locally. 
        Please find a list of these events below, and feel free to get in touch with each event's organiser(s) for more details. 
        More events will be added as we get closer to the conference date.
