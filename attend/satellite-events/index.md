        Though the decision has been made to transform IEEE VR 2022 into an all-digital online conference experience, several members 
        of the IEEE VR community around the world have agreed to organise small meeting hubs for those able to travel locally. 
        Please find a list of these events below, and feel free to get in touch with each event's organiser(s) for more details. 
        More events will be added as we get closer to the conference date.

        We are organizing a satellite event at Universidad de los Andes. All registered members are welcomed to visit us and share the experience as if we 
        were in the conference. Due to time zone differences, the satellite event will be just during our afternoons, which will correspond to the morning 
        sessions of the next day in NZ. Space is limited, so let us know at your earliest convenience that you are coming.</p>
