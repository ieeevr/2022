        Do you miss your VR colleagues? Would you be interested in attending a satellite IEEE VR 2022
        at Davidson College (near Charlotte, NC)? IEEE VR 2022 attendees (registration required) will 
        watch the presentations and keynote talks as a group. Additionally, we will be able to network,
        socialize, and maybe even have an outdoor sing-along. This is currently a simple, small event 
        with coffee breaks, and one box lunch supported by Davidson College. <i>Please let us know if
        your institution would be interested in further sponsoring this event.</i></p>
