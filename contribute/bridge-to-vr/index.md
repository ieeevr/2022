    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The 29<sup>th</sup> IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2022 seeks outstanding 
        candidates to participate in the Bridge to VR program. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Successful applicants will have the opportunity to participate in the IEEE VR conference, the 
        premier international venue for the presentation of research results in the broad area of 
        virtual reality. The aim of this program is to enable undergraduate students interested in 
        VR <strong>to participate in the conference with current scholars</strong> and to encourage 
        these students to <strong>pursue VR research in academic settings</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being part of this program is a great way to learn the state of the VR field and to participate 
        in the sharing of academic research. Awardees will be able to virtually attend presentations and 
        demos at the 2022 IEEE VR conference. Awardees will also be asked to share their learnings from the 
        conference with their own academic and professional networks via social media, presentations, 
        or another method of the awardee's choosing.
