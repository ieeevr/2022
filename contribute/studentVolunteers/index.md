    <h2 id="benefits"> Benefits </h2>

        This year, IEEE VR will take place as a <b>virtual conference</b>, for this reason, SVs will have particular tasks, a more prominent role and the opportunity to be much more involved with the conference attendees. Besides the stimulating experience, SVs will receive an excellent package of benefits that includes: free registration*, 1 year IEEE Student membership and an exclusive organizing team shirt.
        * If you are an author, make sure to have one of your co-authors register and pay full fee according to your publication.

    <h2 id="expectations"> Expectations</h2>
    <p>
        You must be willing to work about <strong>15 to 20 hours</strong> during the conference. Furthermore, you must be available for SV orientation before the conference begins. Your SV duties will include:  helping with the setup of the virtual environment, providing assistance to speakers and attendees and more. If you cannot commit yourself to this time frame and this amount of work, then please do not take away a slot from another willing student.
