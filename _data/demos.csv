PO1002,Distant Hand Interaction Framework in Augmented Reality,"Jesus Ugarte, Nahal Norouzi, Austin Erickson, Gerd Bruder, Greg Welch","Recent augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays support shared multi-user experiences, with past research studying the enhancement of interpersonal communication cues. However, less is known about distant interaction in AR and, in particular, distant communication. In this demonstration, we present a research framework for distant hand interaction in AR, including different techniques for hand communication, such as distant communication through symbolic hand gestures and distant drawing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD97erd3lxI,Expo Hall A,C27
PO1003,Mid-air Haptic Texture Exploration in VR,"Orestis Georgiou, Jonatan Martinez, Abdenaceur Abdouni, Adam Harwood","Mid-air haptic feedback has traditionally been used to enhance gesture input interactions. Here we present a VR research demo that expands such interactions to include for active haptic exploration. In the demo, the user can explore a virtual object using both hands and feel its intrinsic properties such as consistency and texture. The paper describes the physical apparatus used, the haptic rendering techniques leveraged, and the demo's relevance to applications such as VR shopping.",https://youtu.be/ABAt3CF6XxU,Expo Hall A,C32
PO1008,We Are Oulu: Exploring Situated Empathy through a Communal Virtual Reality Experience,"Mohammad Sina Kiarostami, Aku Visuri, Simo Hosio","In this research, we explore and measure situated empathy. We focus on the hardships of an international community in a foreign country using a virtual reality experiment. Our aim is to facilitate a better understanding of an international community's quality of life and unique difficulties in a society. To this end, we designed a VR experiment with three main stages: data collection, a pre-experiment questionnaire and a post-experiment questionnaire with a concluding interview.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWQQBg16_xo,Expo Hall A,C26
PO1011,Asymmetric interfaces with stylus and gesture for VR sketching,"Qianyuan Zou, Huidong Bai, Lei Gao, Allan Fowler, Mark Billinghurst","Virtual Reality (VR) can be used for design and artistic applications. However, traditional symmetrical input devices are not specifically designed as creative tools and may not fully meet artist needs. In this demonstration, we present a variety of tool-based asymmetric VR interfaces to assist artists to create artwork with better performance and easier effort. We conducted a pilot study showing that most users prefer to create art with different tools in both hands.",https://youtu.be/fLlSrU3GpkA,Expo Hall A,C33
PO1012,Pixel Processor Arrays For Low Latency Gaze Estimation,"Laurie Bose, Piotr Dudek, Stephen Carey, Jianing Chen","We demonstrate gaze tracking at over 10,000 Hz, with processing latency below 0.1 ms via use of a Pixel Processor Array (PPA) vision sensor. The PPA allows visual data to be processed efficiently at the point of light capture. By extracting features used for gaze tracking upon the PPA, we reduce data transfer from sensor to processing from entire images to a hand-full of contextual bytes, saving significant power, time and allowing for frame-rates far exceeding traditional camera sensors.",https://youtu.be/x2Ac1Y8hhW4,Expo Hall A,C25
PO1013,Aroaro - A Tool for Distributed Immersive Mixed Reality Visualization,"Fernando Beltr&aacute;n, David C White, Jing Geng","In this research demo we present three immersive scenarios on three XR modalities - VR, immersive AR on HoloLens and 2D AR on Android. 
These scenarios are a network of Harry Potter characters in VR, a map-based visualization of a soldier's history with rich attributes including images and sound on HoloLens, and a visualization of car racing on Android. 
These visualizations have been created with Aroaro our distributed mixed reality data visualization tool.",,Expo Hall A,C34
PO1014,3DColAR: Exploring 3D Colour Selection and Surface Painting for Head Worn AR using Hand Gestures,"Louise M Lawrence. Gun Lee, Mark Billinghurst, Damien Rompapas","Color selection and surface painting has been largely unexplored in head-worn AR using hand gestures. We present a system with two key approaches for painting a virtual 3D model using mid- air hand gestures. This includes a virtual pen which the user can grasp using their hand, and the use of the user's fingertip directly. We hope to explore how the various techniques effect users when performing surface painting of virtual objects using mid-air hand gestures via. several user 
studies.",https://youtu.be/PGOm-8Vf3Po,,TBD
PO1015,B-Handy: An Augmented Reality System for Biomechanical Measurement,"James O Campbell, Alvaro Cassinelli, Daniel Saakes, Damien Rompapas",The study of Bio-mechanics allows us to infer measurements without measuring tools. A limitation comes from the complex mental transformations of space involved. The efficiency of this task degrades the larger these measurements become. We present a system that offloads this mental workload by providing visual transformations of space in the form of tracking and duplicating the user's hand in AR.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZOsmsZHv3U,,TBD
PO1016,ORUN - A Virtual reality serious-game for kinematics learning,"Jhasmani Tito, Regina Moraes, Tania Basso","Virtual Reality is one of the new educational technologies that has an imperative importance due to the possibilities that it offers, such as bringing hands-on experiences for learning physics phenomena. This demo is a serious game, based on VR, and focused on learning of specific concepts of kinematics. The game is intended to deliver an immersive experience in which the student has an active role and whose game design includes theoretical concepts to maintain engagement throughout the tasks.",https://youtu.be/B2Ay-LsVHkA,,TBD
PO1017,Demonstrating Immersive Gesture Exploration with GestureExplorer,"Ang Li, Jiazhou Liu, Maxime Cordeil, Barrett Ens","We demonstrate GestureExplorer, which features versatile immersive visualisations to grant the user free control over their perspective, allowing them to gain a better understanding of gestures. It provides multiple data visualisation views, and interactive features to support analysis and exploration of gesture data sets. This demonstration shows the potential of GestureExplorer for providing a useful and engaging experience for exploring gesture data.",https://youtu.be/Kq9APfo7DFc,,TBD

In each version, 4 scenarios of interaction with a virtual assistant in a sci-fi location are implemented, each of them lasting several minutes. The IVE is supplemented with tools for automatic generating reports on user behavior (clicktracking, audiotracking and eyetracking).",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgwrknpn5tY,,TBD

Our design supports learners to remain engaged in listening to and learning about the marginalized other. Our analysis describes how participants reflect upon and use the interactions to move through the difficulties of listening to another's stories of marginalization.,https://youtu.be/orsG09QrLbs,,TBD
