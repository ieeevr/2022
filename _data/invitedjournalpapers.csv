I1000,OctoPocus in VR: Using a Dynamic Guide for 3D Mid-Air Gestures in Virtual Reality,,,"Bau and Mackays OctoPocus dynamic guide helps novices learn, execute, and remember 2D surface gestures. We adapt OctoPocus to 3D mid-air gestures in Virtual Reality (VR) using an optimization-based recognizer, and by introducing an optional exploration mode to help visualize the spatial complexity of guides in a 3D gesture set. A replication of the original experiment protocol is used to compare OctoPocus in VR with a VR implementation of a crib-sheet. Results show that despite requiring 0.9s more reaction time than crib-sheet, OctoPocus enables participants to execute gestures 1.8s faster with 13.8 percent more accuracy during training,while remembering a comparable number of gestures. Subjective ratings support these results, 75 percent of participants found OctoPocus easier to learn and 83 percent found it more accurate. We contribute an implementation and empirical evidence demonstrating that an adaptation of the OctoPocus guide to VR is feasible and beneficial.","Katherine Fennedy, Jeremy Hartmann, Quentin Roy, Simon Tangi Perrault, Daniel Vogel",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3101854
I1001,EHTask: Recognizing User Tasks from Eye and Head Movements in Immersive Virtual Reality,,,"Understanding human visual attention in immersive virtual reality (VR) is crucial for many important applications, including gaze prediction, gaze guidance, and gaze-contingent rendering. However, previous works on visual attention analysis typically only explored one specific VR task and paid less attention to the differences between different tasks. Moreover, existing task recognition methods typically focused on 2D viewing conditions and only explored the effectiveness of human eye movements. We first collect eye and head movements of 30 participants performing four tasks, i.e. Free viewing, Visual search, Saliency, and Track, in 15 360-degree VR videos. Using this dataset, we analyze the patterns of human eye and head movements and reveal significant differences across different tasks in terms of fixation duration, saccade amplitude, head rotation velocity, and eye-head coordination. We then propose EHTask -- a novel learning-based method that employs eye and head movements to recognize user tasks in VR. We show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods derived from 2D viewing conditions both on our dataset (accuracy of 84.4% vs. 62.8%) and on a real-world dataset (61.9% vs. 44.1%). As such, our work provides meaningful insights into human visual attention under different VR tasks and guides future work on recognizing user tasks in VR.","Zhiming Hu, Andreas Bulling, Sheng Li, Guoping Wang",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3138902
I1002,UrbanRama: Navigating Cities in Virtual Reality,,,"Exploring large virtual environments, such as cities, is a central task in several domains, such as gaming and urban planning. VR systems can greatly help this task by providing an immersive experience&#59; however, a common issue with viewing and navigating a city in the traditional sense is that users can either obtain a local or a global view, but not both at the same time, requiring them to continuously switch between perspectives, losing context and distracting them from their analysis. In this paper, our goal is to allow users to navigate to points of interest without changing perspectives. To accomplish this, we design an intuitive navigation interface that takes advantage of the strong sense of spatial presence provided by VR. We supplement this interface with a perspective that warps the environment, called UrbanRama, based on a cylindrical projection, providing a mix of local and global views. The design of this interface was performed as an interactive process in collaboration with architects and urban planners. We conducted a qualitative and a quantitative pilot user study to evaluate UrbanRama and the results indicate the effectiveness of our system in reducing perspective changes, while ensuring that the warping doesnt affect distance and orientation perception.","Shaoyu Chen, Fabio Miranda, Nivan Ferreira, Marcos Lage, Harish Doraiswamy, Corinne Brenner, Connor Defanti, Michael Koutsoubis, Luc Wilson, Kenneth Perlin, Claudio T Silva",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3099012
I1003,HaptoMapping: Visuo-Haptic Augmented Reality by Embedding User-Imperceptible Tactile Display Control Signals in a Projected Image,,,"This paper proposes HaptoMapping, a projection-based visuo-haptic augmented reality (VHAR) system, that can render visual and haptic content independently and present consistent visuo-haptic sensations on physical surfaces. HaptoMapping controls wearable haptic displays by embedded control signals that are imperceptible to the user in projected images using a pixel-level visible light communication technique. The prototype system is comprised of a high-speed projector and three types of haptic devicesfinger worn, stylus, and arm mounted. The finger-worn and stylus devices present vibrotactile sensations to a users fingertips. The arm-mounted device presents stroking sensations on a users forearm using arrayed actuators with a synchronized hand projection mapping. We identified that the developed systems maximum latency of haptic from visual sensations was 93.4 ms. We conducted user studies on the latency perception of our VHAR system. The results revealed that the developed haptic devices can present haptic sensations without user-perceivable latencies, and the visual-haptic latency tolerance of our VHAR system was 100, 159, 500 ms for the finger-worn, stylus, and arm-mounted devices, respectively. Another user study with the arm-mounted device discovered that the visuo-haptic stroking system maintained both continuity and pleasantness when the spacing between each substrate was relatively sparse, such as 20 mm, and significantly improved both the continuity and pleasantness at 80 and 150 mm/s when compared to the haptic only stroking system. Lastly, we introduced four potential applications in daily scenes. Our system methodology allows for a wide range of VHAR application design without concern for latency and misalignment effects.","Yamato Miyatake, Takefumi Hiraki, Daisuke Iwai, Kosuke Sato",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3136214
I1004,Design of a Pupil-Matched Occlusion-Capable Optical See-Through Wearable Display,,,"The state-of-the-art optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMD) for augmented reality applications lack the ability to render correct light interaction behavior between digital and physical objects, known as mutual occlusion capability. This paper presents a novel optical architecture for enabling a compact, high performance, occlusion-capable optical see-through head-mounted display (OCOST-HMD) with correct, pupil-matched viewing perspective. The proposed design utilizes a single-layer, double-pass architecture, offering a compact OCOST-HMD solution that is capable of rendering per-pixel mutual occlusion, a correctly pupil-matched viewing between virtual and real views, and a very wide see-through field of view (FOV). Based on this architecture, we demonstrate a design embodiment and a compact prototype implementation. The prototype offers a virtual display with an FOV of 34 by 22, an angular resolution of 1.06 arc minutes per pixel, and an average image contrast greater than 40% at the Nyquist frequency of 53 cycles/mm. Further, the prototype system affords a wide see-though FOV of 90 by 50, within which about 40 diagonally is occlusion-enabled, along with an angular resolution of 1.0 arc minutes, comparable to a 20/20 vision and a dynamic range greater than 100:1. Lastly, we composed a quantitative color study that compares the effects of occlusion between a conventional HMD system and our OCOST-HMD system and the resulting response exhibited in different studies.","Austin Wilson, Hong Hua",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3076069
I1005,Being an Avatar &quot;for Real&quot;: a Survey on Virtual Embodiment in Augmented Reality,,,"Virtual self-avatars have been increasingly used in Augmented Reality (AR) where one can see virtual content embedded into physical space. However, little is known about the perception of self-avatars in such a context. The possibility that their embodiment could be achieved in a similar way as in Virtual Reality opens the door to numerous applications in education, communication, entertainment, or the medical field. This article aims to review the literature covering the embodiment of virtual self-avatars in AR. Our goal is (i) to guide readers through the different options and challenges linked to the implementation of AR embodiment systems, (ii) to provide a better understanding of AR embodiment perception by classifying the existing knowledge, and (iii) to offer insight on future research topics and trends for AR and avatar research. To do so, we introduce a taxonomy of virtual embodiment experiences by defining a &quot;body avatarization&quot; continuum. The presented knowledge suggests that the sense of embodiment evolves in the same way in AR as in other settings, but this possibility has yet to be fully investigated. We suggest that, whilst it is yet to be well understood, the embodiment of avatars has a promising future in AR and conclude by discussing possible directions for research.","Adelaide Charlotte Sarah Genay, Anatole Lecuyer, Martin Hachet",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3099290
I1006,A Wheelchair Locomotion Interface in a VR Disability Simulation Reduces Implicit Bias,,,"This research investigates how experiencing virtual embodiment in a wheelchair affects implicit bias towards people who use wheelchairs. We also investigate how receiving information from a virtual instructor who uses a wheelchair affects implicit bias towards people who use wheelchairs. Implicit biases are actions or judgments of people towards various concepts or stereotypes (e.g., races). We hypothesized that experiencing a Disability Simulation (DS) through an avatar in a wheelchair and receiving information from an instructor with a disability will have a significant effect on participants' ability to recall disability-related information and will reduce implicit biases towards people who use wheelchairs. To investigate this hypothesis, a 2x2 between-subjects user study was conducted where participants experienced an immersive VR DS that presents information about Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with factors of instructor (i.e., instructor with a disability vs instructor without a disability) and locomotion interface (i.e., without a disability -- locomotion through in-place-walking, with a disability -- locomotion in a wheelchair). Participants took a disability-focused Implicit Association Test two times, once before and once after experiencing the DS. They also took a test of knowledge retention about MS. The primary result is: experiencing the DS through locomotion in a wheelchair was better for both the disability-related information recall task and reducing implicit bias towards people who use wheelchairs.","Tanvir Irfan Chowdhury, John Quarles",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3099115
I1007,Virtual replicas of real places: Experimental investigations,,,"As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes cheaper, higher-quality, and more widely available, it is seeing increasing use in a variety of applications including cultural heritage, real estate, and architecture. A common goal for all these applications is a compelling virtual recreation of a real place. Despite this, there has been very little research into how users perceive and experience such replicated spaces. This paper reports the results from a series of three user studies investigating this topic. Results include that the scale of the room and large objects in it are most important for users to perceive the room as real and that non-physical behaviors such as objects floating in air are readily noticeable and have a negative effect even when the errors are small in scale.","Richard Skarbez, Joe Gabbard, Doug A Bowman, Todd Ogle, Thomas Tucker",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3096494
I1008,The Effect of Exploration Mode and Frame of Reference in Immersive Analytics,,,"The design space for user interfaces for Immersive Analytics applications is vast. Designers can combine navigation and manipulation to enable data exploration with ego- or exocentric views, have the user operate at different scales, or use different forms of navigation with varying levels of physical movement. This freedom results in a multitude of different viable approaches. Yet, there is no clear understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each choice. Our goal is to investigate the affordances of several major design choices, to enable both application designers and users to make better decisions. In this work, we assess two main factors, exploration mode and frame of reference, consequently also varying visualization scale and physical movement demand. To isolate each factor, we implemented nine different conditions in a Space-Time Cube visualization use case and asked 36 participants to perform multiple tasks. We analyzed the results in terms of performance and qualitative measures and correlated them with participants' spatial abilities. While egocentric room-scale exploration significantly reduced mental workload, exocentric exploration improved performance in some tasks. Combining navigation and manipulation made tasks easier by reducing workload, temporal demand, and physical effort.","Jorge Wagner, Wolfgang Stuerzlinger, Luciana Nedel",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3060666
I1009,Adaptive Reset Techniques for Haptic Retargeted Interaction,,,"This paper presents a set of adaptive reset techniques for use with haptic retargeting systems focusing on interaction with hybrid virtual reality interfaces that align with a physical interface. Haptic retargeting between changing physical and virtual targets requires a reset where the physical and virtual hand positions are re-aligned. We present a modified Point technique to guide the user in the direction of their next interaction such that the remaining distance to the target is minimized upon completion of the reset. This, along with techniques drawn from existing work are further modified to consider the angular and translational gain of each redirection and identify the optimal position for the reset to take place. When the angular and translational gain is within an acceptable range, the reset can be entirely omitted. This enables continuous retargeting between targets removing interruptions from a sequence of retargeted interactions. These techniques were evaluated in a user study which showed that adaptive reset techniques can provide a significant decrease in task completion time, travel distance, and the number of user errors.","Brandon Matthews, Bruce H Thomas, Stewart Von Itzstein, Ross Smith",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3120410
I1010,Shedding Light on Cast Shadows: An Investigation of Perceived Ground Contact in AR and VR,,,"Virtual objects in augmented reality (AR) often appear to float atop real world surfaces, which makes it difficult to determine where they are positioned in space. This is problematic as many applications for AR require accurate spatial perception. In the current study, we examine how the way we render cast shadows--which act as an important monocular depth cue for creating a sense of contact between an object and the surface beneath it--impacts spatial perception. Over two experiments, we evaluate people's sense of surface contact given both traditional and non-traditional shadow shading methods in optical see-through augmented reality (OST AR), video see-through augmented reality (VST AR), and virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays. Our results provide evidence that nontraditional shading techniques for rendering shadows in AR displays may enhance the accuracy of one's perception of surface contact. This finding implies a possible tradeoff between photorealism and accuracy of depth perception, especially in OST AR displays. However, it also supports the use of more stylized graphics like non-traditional cast shadows to improve perception and interaction in AR applications.","Haley Adams, Jeanine Stefanucci, Sarah H Creem-Regehr, Grant Pointon, William B Thompson, Bobby Bodenheimer",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3097978
I1011,Multisensory Proximity and Transition Cues for Improving Target Awareness in Narrow Field of View Augmented Reality Displays,,,"Augmented reality applications allow users to enrich their real surroundings with additional digital content. However, due to the limited field of view of augmented reality devices, it can sometimes be difficult to become aware of newly emerging information inside or outside the field of view. Typical visual conflicts like clutter and occlusion of augmentations occur and can be further aggravated especially in the context of dense information spaces. In this article, we evaluate how multisensory cue combinations can improve the awareness for moving out-of-view objects in narrow field of view augmented reality displays. We distinguish between proximity and transition cues in either visual, auditory or tactile manner. Proximity cues are intended to enhance spatial awareness of approaching out-of-view objects while transition cues inform the user that the object just entered the field of view. In study 1, user preference was determined for 6 different cue combinations via forced-choice decisions. In study 2, the 3 most preferred modes were then evaluated with respect to performance and awareness measures in a divided attention reaction task. Both studies were conducted under varying noise levels. We show that on average the Visual-Tactile combination leads to 63% and Audio-Tactile to 65% faster reactions to incoming out-of-view augmentations than their Visual-Audio counterpart, indicating a high usefulness of tactile transition cues. We further show a detrimental effect of visual and audio noise on performance when feedback included visual proximity cues. Based on these results, we make recommendations to determine which cue combination is appropriate for which application.","Christina Trepkowski, Alexander Marquardt, Tom David Eibich, Yusuke Shikanai, Jens Maiero, Kiyoshi Kiyokawa, Ernst Kruijff, Johannes Schoning, Peter Konig",https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3116673
I1012,Dynamic Projection Mapping for Robust Sphere Posture Tracking Using Uniform/Biased Circumferential Markers,,,"In spatial augmented reality, a widely dynamic projection mapping system has been developed as a novel approach to graphics presentation for widely moving objects in dynamic situations. However, this method necessitates a novel tracking marker design that is resistant to random and complex occlusion and out-of-focus blurring, which conventional markers have not achieved. This study presents a uniform circumferential marker that becomes an ellipse in perspective projection and expresses geometric information. It can track the relative posture of a dynamically moving sphere with high speed, high accuracy, and robustness owing to continuous contour lines, thereby supporting both wide-range movement in the depth direction and human interaction. Moreover, a biased circumferential marker is proposed to embed unique coding, where the absolute posture is decoded with a novel recognition algorithm. Moreover, rough initialization using the geometry of multiple ellipses is proposed for both markers to start the automatic and precise tracking. Real-time rotation visualization onto the surface of a moving sphere is made possible with the high-speed, widely dynamic projection mapping system. The tracking performance is demonstrated to exhibit sufficient basic tracking performance as well as robustness against blurring and occlusion compared to conventional dot-based markers.","Yuri Mikawa, Tomohiro Sueishi, Yoshihiro Watanabe, Masatoshi Ishikawa",https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3111085
