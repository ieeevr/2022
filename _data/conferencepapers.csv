C1014,Bullet Comments for 360&#176; Video,,,"Time-anchored on-screen comments, as known as bullet comments, are a popular feature for online video streaming. Bullet comments reflect audiences' feelings and opinions at specific video timings, which have been shown to be beneficial to video content understanding and social connection level. In this paper, we for the first time investigate the problem of bullet comment display and insertion for 360&#176; video via head-mounted display and controller. We design four bullet comment display methods and propose two controller-based methods for bullet comment insertion. User study results revealed how the factors of display and insertion methods affect 360&#176; video experience.","Yi-Jun Li, Jinchuan Shi, Fang-Lue Zhang, Miao Wang",
C1039,Investigating how speech and motion realism influence the perceived personality of virtual characters and agents.,,,"The portrayed personality of virtual characters and agents influences how we perceive and engage with digital applications. Understanding the influence of speech and animation allows us to design more personalized and engaging characters. Using performance capture data from multiple datasets, we contrast performance-driven characters to those portrayed by generated gestures and synthesized speech, analysing how the features of each influence personality according to the Big Five personality traits. Our results highlight motion as dominant for portraying extraversion and speech for communicating agreeableness and emotional stability, supporting the development of virtual characters, social agents and 3DUI agents with targeted personalities.","Sean Thomas, Ylva Ferstl, Rachel McDonnell, Cathy Ennis",
C1042,"Exploring and Selecting Supershapes in Virtual Reality with Line, Quad, and Cube Shaped Widgets",,,"In this work, we propose VR shape widgets that allow users to probe and select supershapes from a multitude of solutions. Our designs take leverage on thumbnails, mini-maps, haptic feedback and spatial interaction, while supporting 1-D, 2-D and 3-D supershape parameter spaces. We conducted a user study (N = 18) and found that VR shape widgets are effective, more efficient, and natural than conventional VR 1-D sliders while also usable for users without prior knowledge on supershapes. We also found that the proposed VR widgets provide a quick overview of the main supershapes, and users can easily reach the desired solution without having to perform fine-grain handle manipulations.","Francisco Nicolau, Johan Gielis, Adalberto L.

C1046,The Virtual Production Studio Concept - An Emerging Game Changer in filmmaking,,,"Virtual Production (VP) integrates virtual and augmented reality technologies with CGI and VFX using a game engine to enable on set production crews to capture and unwrap scenes in real time. In this sense, it is a game changer for the traditional film industry. This paper analyses the VP studio and the use of LED as the pivotal element of this process from a technical and conceptual perspective. As the interest in the field is growing rapidly, we endeavour to evaluate the developments to date in Australia to build a snapshot of emerging VP practices and research supported by two case studies.","Manolya Kavakli, Cinzia Cremona",
C1052,An improved augmented-reality method of inserting virtual objects into the scene with transparent objects,,,"In augmented reality, the insertion of virtual objects into the real scene needs to meet the requirements of visual consistency. When there are transparent objects in the real scene, the difference in refractive index and roughness of transparent objects will influence the effect of the virtual and real fusion. To tackle this problem, we solve for the material parameters of objects and illumination simultaneously by nesting microfacet model and hemispherical area illumination model into inverse path tracing. Multiple experiments verify that the proposed approach performs better than the state-of-the-art method.","Aijia Zhang, Yan Zhao, Shigang Wang, Jian Wei",
C1059,SivsFormer: Parallax-Aware Transformers for Single-image-based View Synthesis,,,"Single-image-based view synthesis is challenging as it requires inferring contents beyond what is immediately visible. The generated views suffer from visually unpleasant holes, deformations, and artifacts by previous methods. We propose SivsFormer for high-quality and realistic view synthesis. In particular, a warping and occlusion handing module is designed to reduce the influence of parallax. Subsequently, a disparity alignment module captures the long-range information over the scene and ensures that pixels move correctly. Moreover, we present a parallax-aware loss function to improve the quality of the synthetic images, which explicitly quantifies the magnitude of parallax. Our approach achieves superior performance.","Chunlan Zhang, Chunyu Lin, Kang Liao, Lang Nie, Yao Zhao",
C1082,Visual Fidelity Effects on Expressive Self-avatar in Virtual Reality: First Impressions Matter,,,"In this work we present a technical pipeline of creating self-alike avatars whose facial expressions can be then controlled in real-time, from inside the HMD. Using this pipeline we conducted two within-group studies on the psychological impact of the appearance realism of self-avatar. We found a &quot;first trial effect&quot; in both studies where participants gave more positive feedback over the avatar from their first trial, regardless of it being realistic or cartoon-like. Our eye-tracking data suggested that although participants were mainly facing their avatar during their presentation, their eye-gaze was focused elsewhere half of the time.","Fang Ma, Xueni Pan",
C1089,Galea: A physiological sensing system for behavioral research in virtual environments,,,"The pairing of Virtual Reality technology with Physiological Sensing has gained much interest in clinical settings and beyond. We present Galea, a device which measures physiological responses when experiencing virtual content, enabling behavioral, affective computing, and human-computer interaction research access to data from the Parasympathetic nervous system and Sympathetic nervous system simultaneously. We provide design considerations and circuit characterization results of in-vivo recordings, and present two examples to help contextualize how these signals can be used in VR settings. We also discuss the importance and contributions of this work and future challenges that should be considered.","Guillermo Bernal, Nelson Hidalgo Julia, Conor Russomanno, Pattie Maes",
C1098,Do You Notice Me? How Bystanders Affect the Cognitive Load in Virtual Reality,,,"In contrast to the real world, users are not able to perceive bystanders in virtual reality. This involves users to feel discomfort at the thought of unintentionally touching or even bumping into a physical bystander while interacting with the virtual environment. Therefore, we investigate how a bystander affects a user's cognitive load. In a between-subjects lab study, three conditions were compared: 1) no bystander, 2) an invisible bystander, and 3) a visible bystander. The results of our study demonstrate that a bystander acting as an avatar in the virtual environment increases the user's cognitive load more than an invisible bystander. Moreover, the cognitive load of a VR user is significantly increased by a bystander.","Maximilian Rettinger, Christoph Schmaderer, Gerhard Rigoll",
C1101,Tapping with a Handheld Stick in VR: Redirection Detection Thresholds for Passive Haptic Feedback,,,"This paper investigates providing grounded passive haptic feedback to a user of a VR application through a handheld stick with which the user taps virtual objects. Two haptics redirection methods are proposed: the DriftingHand method, which alters the position of the user's virtual hand, and the VariStick method, which alters the length of the virtual stick. Detection thresholds were measured in a user study (N = 60) for multiple stick lengths and multiple distances from the user to the real object. VariStick and DriftingHand provide an undetectable range of offsets of &#91;-20cm,+13cm&#93; and &#91;-11cm, +11cm&#93;, respectively.","Yuqi Zhou, Voicu Popescu",
C1102,Exploring the Design Space for Immersive Embodiment in Dance,,,"How can virtual reality (VR) support people in more deeply inhabiting their own bodies? Through action research, we explored the design space for how VR can support feeling embodied and generating movement within a dance context. We observed and reflected on participants' experiences with games intended to stimulate physical movement, single player and multiplayer 3D painting, 360 live video, and custom real-time audio and visual feedback based on motion capture. We present a design space that encapsulates our insights, with axes for control, collaboration, auditory and visual feedback. We discuss implications for the support of immersive embodiment in dance.","Danielle Lottridge, Becca Weber, Eva-Rae McLean, Hazel Williams, Joanna Cook, Huidong Bai",
C1110,Asymmetric Lateral Field-of-View Restriction to Mitigate Cybersickness During Virtual Turns,,,"We propose and evaluate a novel variant of field-of-view restriction that uses an asymmetric mask to obscure only one side region of the periphery during rotation and laterally shifts the center of restriction towards the direction of the turn. A between-subjects study was conducted to compare the side restrictor, a traditional symmetric restrictor, and a control condition without restriction. The side restrictor was effective in mitigating cybersickness, reducing discomfort, improving subjective visibility, and enabling longer immersion time. These results indicate that side field-of-view restriction is an effective cybersickness mitigation technique for virtual environments with frequent turns.","Fei Wu, Evan Suma Rosenberg",
C1145,STROE: An Ungrounded String-Based Weight Simulation Device,,,"We present STROE, a new ungrounded string-based weight simulation device. STROE is worn as an add-on to a shoe that in turn is connected to the user's hand via a controllable string. A motor is pulling the string with a force according to the weight to be simulated. The design of STROE allows the users to move more freely than other state-of-the-art devices for weight simulation. We conducted a user study that empirically shows that STROE is able to simulate the weight of various objects and, in doing so, increases users' perceived realism and immersion of VR scenes.","Alexander Achberger, Pirathipan Arulrajah, Kresimir Vidackovic, Michael Sedlmair",
C1146,The Influence of Environmental Lighting on Size Variations in Optical See-through Tangible Augmented Reality,,,"It is not possible to use a physical replica for each virtual object interacted with in Tangible Augmented Reality. Investigations to what extent a physical object can differ from its virtual counterpart are necessary. Since perception in optical see-through Augmented Reality is strongly influenced by the ambient lighting, we examined under three different indoor lighting conditions how much the physical object can differ in size from its virtual representation. As illuminance increases, usability and presence decrease, but the size ranges in which a physical object can deviate without having a strong negative impact on usability, presence and performance increase.","Denise Kahl, Marc Ruble, Antonio Kr&uuml;ger",
C1150,LevelEd SR: A Substitutional Reality Level Design Workflow,,,"We present LevelEd SR, a substitutional reality level design workflow that combines AR and VR systems and is built for consumer devices. The system enables passive haptics through the inclusion of physical objects from within a space into a virtual world. A validation study produced quantitative data that suggests players benefit from passive haptics in VR games with an improved game experience and increased levels of presence. An evaluation found that participants were accepting of the system, rating it positively using the System Usability Scale questionnaire and would want to use it again to experience substitutional reality.","Lee Beever, Nigel W. John",
C1159,Effects of Field of View on Dynamic Out-of-View Target Search in Virtual Reality,,,"We present a study of the effects of field of view (FOV), target movement, and number of targets on visual search performance in virtual reality. We compared visual search tasks in two FOVs (&#126;65&#176;, &#126;32.5&#176;) under two target movement speeds (static, dynamic) while varying the visible target count, with targets potentially out of the user's view. We examined the expected linear relationship between search time and number of items, to explore how moving and/or out-of-view targets affected this relationship. Overall, search performance increased with a wide FOV, but decreased when targets were moving and with more visible targets. Neither FOV nor target movement meaningfully altered the linear relationship between search time and number of items.","Kristen Grinyer, Robert J. Teather",
C1168,Mixed Reality Co-Design for Indigenous Culture Preservation &amp; Continuation,,,"Decades of M&#x101;ori urbanisation, colonisation and globalisation have dispersed marae communities away from their tribal home all around NZ and overseas. This has left many feeling disconnected from learning their cultural identity. M&#x101;ori have sought digital solutions to mitigate this problem by finding ways of preserving and continuing their culture using immersive technologies. We achieve this by developing an application which places M&#x101;ori back into their ancestral meeting house and allow them to hear 3D stories about their people. For other researchers and developers involved in an indigenous project, we recommend using a participatory co-design process when developing MR applications for indigenous preservation and continuation.","Noel Park, Holger Regenbrecht, Stuart Duncan, Steven Mills, Robert W.

C1172,Empathic AuRea: Exploring the Effects of an Augmented Reality Cue for Emotional Sharing Across Three Face-to-Face Tasks,,,"The better a speaker can understand their listener's emotions, the better can they transmit information&#59; and the better a listener can understand the speaker's emotions, the better can they apprehend that information. Previous emotional sharing works have managed to elicit emotional understanding between remote collaborators using bio-sensing, but how face-to-face communication can benefit from bio-feedback is still fairly unexplored. This paper introduces an AR communication cue from an emotion recognition neural network model and ECG data. A study where pairs of participants engaged in three tasks found our system to positively effect performance and emotional understanding, but negatively effect memorization.","Andreia Valente, Daniel S. Lopes, Nuno Jardim Nunes, Augusto Esteves",
C1176,Foldable Spaces: An Overt Redirection Approach for Natural Walking in Virtual Reality,,,"We propose Foldable Spaces, a novel overt redirection approach that dynamically 'folds' the geometry of the virtual environment to enable natural walking. Based on this approach, we developed three techniques: (1) Horizontal, which folds virtual space like the pages in a book&#59; (2) Vertical, which rotates virtual space along a vertical axis&#59; and (3) Accordion, which corrugates virtual space to bring faraway places closer to the user. In a within-subjects study, we compared our foldable techniques along with a base condition, Stop &amp; Reset. Our findings show that Accordion was the most continuous and preferred technique for experiencing natural walking.","Jihae Han, Andrew Vande Moere, Adalberto L. Simeone",

We derived system and design requirements from observations of a military on-site staff exercise and evaluated our prototype, we conducted semi-structured interviews with domain experts. Our results show that the potential of VR-based tactical resource planning is dependent on the technical features as well as on non-technical environmental aspects, such as user attitude, prior experience, and interoperability.","Maria L.

C1198,Within or Between? Comparing Experimental Designs for Virtual Embodiment Studies,,,"This paper reports a within-subjects experiment with 92 participants comparing embodiment under a visuomotor task with two conditions: synchronous and asynchronous motions. We explored the impact of the number of participants on the replicability of the results from the 92 within-subjects experiment. Results showed that while the replicability of the results increased with the number of participants for the within-subjects simulations, no matter the number of participants, between-subjects simulations were not able to replicate the initial results. We discuss potential reasons that could have lead to this and potential methodological practices to mitigate them.","Gr&eacute;goire Richard, Thomas Pietrzak, Ferran Argelaguet Sanz, Anatole L&eacute;cuyer, G&eacute;ry Casiez",
C1199,Inducing Emotional Stress from the ICU Context in VR,,,"Nurses in ICUs can suffer from emotional stress, which may severely effect their health and impact the quality of care. Stress Inoculation Training is a promising method to learn coping strategies. It involves stressors in a controlled environment at increasing intensity. In this work, using VR, we implement an emotional (moral) stressor in three intensity levels, based on literature reviews and expert interviews. In a user study, subjects deal with virtual characters while experiencing the stressor of having to comply with the patient's family wishes against ones own beliefs. Resulting stress was measured in objective and subjective ways. We show that emotional stress can be induced using VR and artificial characters.","Sebastian Wei&szlig;, Steffen Busse, Wilko Heuten",
C1206,Body Warping Versus Change Blindness Remapping: A Comparison of Two Approaches to Repurposing Haptic Proxies for Virtual Reality,,,"This paper details a study comparing two techniques for repurposing haptic proxies&#59; namely haptic retargeting based on body warping and change blindness remapping. Participants performed a simple button-pressing task, and 24 virtual buttons were mapped onto four haptic proxies with varying degrees of misalignment. Body warping and change blindness remapping were used to realign the real and virtual buttons, and the results indicate that users failed to reliably detect realignment of up to 7.9 cm for body warping and up to 9.7 cm for change blindness remapping. Moreover, change blindness remapping yielded significantly higher self-reported agency, and marginally higher ownership.","Cristian Patras, Mantas Cibulskis, Niels Christian Nilsson",
C1208,Evaluating Visual Cues for Future Airborne Surveillance Using Simulated Augmented Reality Displays,,,"This work explores bringing Augmented Reality (AR) to airborne surveillance operators. In a Virtual Reality (VR) simulation replicating the environment of surveillance aircrafts, we introduce AR cues and an AR control panel to support search tasks and secondary tasks, respectively. Our high-fidelity simulation factors in the focal plane of the AR technology and simulates the user's eye accommodation reflex. Results collected from 24 participants show that the effectiveness of the cues depends on the modality of the secondary task and that, under certain situations, choosing the right focal plane for the AR display may improve search task performances.","Nicolas Barbotin, James Baumeister, Andrew Cunningham, Thierry Duval, Olivier Grisvard, Bruce H.

C1215,Design and Evaluation of Travel and Orientation Techniques for Desk VR,,,"Typical VR interactions can be tiring, resulting in decreased comfort and session duration compared with traditional non-VR interfaces, which may, in turn, reduce productivity. Desk VR experiences provide the convenience and comfort of a desktop experience and the benefits of VR immersion. We explore travel and orientations techniques targeted at desk VR users, using both controllers and a large multi-touch surface. Results revealed advantages for a continuous controller-based travel method and a trend for a dragging-based orientation technique. Also, we identified possible trends towards task focus affecting overall cybersickness symptomatology.","Guilherme dos Santos Amaro, Daniel Mendes, Rui Rodrigues",
C1216,Empirical Evaluation of Calibration and Long-term Carryover Effects of Reverberation on Egocentric Auditory Depth Perception in VR,,,"We conducted a study to understand the perceptual learning and carryover effects by using RT as stimuli for users to perceive distance in IVEs. The results show that the carryover effect exists after calibration, which indicates people can learn to perceive distances by attuning reverberation time, and the accuracy even remains a constant level after 6 months.","WanYi Lin, Ying-Chu Wang, Dai-rong Wu, Rohith Venkatakrishnan, Roshan Venkatakrishnan, Elham Ebrahimi, Christopher Pagano, Sabarish V.

C1223,The Smell Engine: A system for artificial odor synthesis in virtual environments,,,"We devise a Smell Engine that presents users with a real-time odor synthesis of smells from a virtual environment. Using the Smell Composer framework, developers can configure odor sources in virtual space, then the Smell Mixer component dynamically estimates the odor mix that the user would smell, and a Smell Controller coordinates an olfactometer to physically present an approximation of the odor mix to the user's mask. Through a three-part user study, we found that the Smell Engine can help measure a subject's olfactory detection threshold and improve their ability to precisely localize odors in the virtual environment.","Alireza Bahremand, Mason Manetta, Jessica Lai, Byron Lahey, Christy Spackman, Brian H.

C1229,Using Speech to Visualise Shared Gaze Cues in MR Remote Collaboration,,,"In this paper, we present a 360 panoramic Mixed Reality (MR) system that visualises shared gaze cues using contextual speech input to improve task coordination. We conducted two studies to evaluate the design of the MR gaze-speech interface exploring the combinations of visualisation style and context control level. Findings from the first study suggest that an explicit visual form that directly connects the collaborators' shared gaze to the contextual conversation is preferred. The second study indicates that the gaze-speech modality shortens the coordination time to attend to the shared interest, making the communication more natural and the collaboration more effective.","Allison Jing, Gun Lee, Mark Billinghurst",
C1242,2D versus 3D: A Comparison of Needle Navigation Concepts between Augmented Reality Display Devices,,,"Only an insufficient amount of fundamental research has focused on the design and hardware selection of such augmented reality needle navigation systems for surgical procedures. We contribute to this area by comparing three state-of-the-art concepts displayed by an optical see-through HMD and stereoscopic projectors. A 2D glyph resulted in higher accuracy but required more insertion time. Punctures guided by 3D see-through vision were less accurate but faster. A static representation of the correctly positioned needle, showed too high target errors. Future work should focus on improving the accuracy of the see-through vision concept. Until then, the glyph visualization is recommended.","Florian Heinrich, Lovis Schwenderling, Fabian Joeres, Christian Hansen",
C1244,Research Trends in Virtual Reality Locomotion Techniques,,,"Virtual reality (VR) researchers have had a long-standing interest in studying locomotion for developing new techniques, improving upon prior ones, and analyzing their effects on users. In this paper, we present a systematic review of locomotion techniques based on a well-established taxonomy, and we use k-means clustering to identify to what extent locomotion techniques have been explored. Our results indicate that selection-based, walking-based, and steering-based locomotion techniques have been moderately to highly explored while manipulation-based and automated locomotion techniques have been less explored. We also present results on what types of metrics have been used to evaluate locomotion techniques.","Esteban Segarra Martinez, Annie S. Wu, Ryan P. McMahan",
C1262,The Stare-in-the-Crowd Effect in Virtual Reality,,,"In this study we explore the stare-in-the crowd effect, an asymmetry in the gaze behaviour of a human observing directed and averted gaze present in a crowd. In virtual reality we have analysed gazes of a group of 30 users, asked to observe a crowd of 11 virtual agents performing 4 different gaze patterns. Results show that the stare-in-the-crowd effect is preserved in VR. We have additionally explored how user gaze behaviour can be affected by social anxiety. Such results are encouraging for the development of expressive and reactive virtual humans, which can be animated to express natural interactive behaviour.","Pierre Raimbaud, Alberto Jovane, Katja Zibrek, Claudio Paccierotti, Marc Christie, Ludovic Hoyet, Julien Pettr&eacute;, Anne-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Olivier",

We demonstrate the strengths of VR-based shoulder surfing research by exploring three different authentication scenarios: automated-teller-machine (ATM), smartphone PIN, and smartphone pattern authentication. Our results show that applying VR for shoulder surfing research is advantageous in many ways compared to currently used approaches (e.g., lab-based 2D video recordings). We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using VR for shoulder surfing research and conclude with four recommendations to help researchers decide when (and when not) to employ VR for shoulder surfing research.","Florian Mathis, Joseph O'Hagan, Mohamed Khamis, Kami Vaniea",

In this paper, we investigate the question of whether the positive effects of social priming are limited to interactions with humanoid entities through a human-subjects experiment. Our mixed-methods analysis revealed positive influences of social priming with humanoid and non-humanoid entities, such as increasing participants' perception of the VH's affective attraction and enhancing participants' quality of experience.","Nahal Norouzi, Matt Gottsacker, Gerd Bruder, Pamela J.

To achieve the continuous transformation superposition, we prepare continuous transformation models for translation, rotation, and perspective transformations. Then we train a policy model to determine an optimal transformation chain to recurrently handle the geometric constraints and disparity adjustment. We further propose an attention-based stereo feature fusion module that enhances and integrates the binocular information. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.","Yuzhong Chen, Qijin Shen, Yuzhen Niu, Wenxi Liu",

They theoretically reliably provide haptics in Virtual environments, yet they raise several intrinsic design challenges to properly display rich haptic feedback and interactions in VR applications. In this paper, we use a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) approach to identify, organise and analyse the failure modes and their causes in the different stages of an ETHD scenario and highlight appropriate solutions from the literature to mitigate them.

We estimate the relative translation gain thresholds in six spatial conditions configured by three room sizes and the presence of virtual objects, which were set according to differing Angles of Declination (AoDs) between eye-gaze and the forward-gaze.

C1309,Real-Time Gaze Tracking with Event-Driven Eye Segmentation,,,"Gaze tracking is an essential component in X-Reality. Modern gaze tracking algorithms are heavyweight&#59; they operate at most 5 Hz on mobile processors despite that cameras can operate at a real-time rate (&gt; 30 Hz). This paper presents a real-time eye tracking algorithm that can operate at 30 Hz on a mobile processor, achieves 0.1&#176;-0.5&#176; gaze accuracies, all the while requiring one to two orders of magnitude smaller parameters than state-of-the-art eye tracking algorithms. The key is an Auto ROI mode, which continuously predicts and processes only the Regions of Interest (ROIs) of near-eye images. In particular, we discuss how to accurately predict ROI by emulating an event camera without requiring special hardware support.","Yu Feng, Nathan Goulding-Hotta, Asif Khan, Hans Reyserhove, Yuhao Zhu",

Existing datasets are small, and make automated learning of real-world behavior features using deep networks challenging. We incorporate real-world constraints such as spatial relationships between devices in the form of displacement vectors and trajectory smoothing in input data for deep networks performing behavior-based identification and authentication. We evaluate our approach against baseline methods that use raw data directly and that perform global normalization. Using displacement vectors, we show higher success over baseline methods in 36 out of 42 cases of varying user sets, VR systems, and sessions.","Robert Miller, Natasha Kholgade Banerjee, Sean Banerjee",

ENI is useful for highlighting regions of incompatibility and guiding the design of the virtual environments to make them more compatible. User studies and simulations show that ENI identifies environments where users are able to walk larger distances before colliding with objects.

Uneven Terrain Increases Cybersickness While Navigating with Head Mounted Displays,,,"Cybersickness poses a challenge to the broader adoption of virtual reality technologies. In this study, we examine the impact of uneven virtual terrain traversal on cybersickness in VR. We recruited 38 participants to navigate with three virtual terrain variants: flat surface, regular bumps, and terrain generated from Perlin noise. We collected cybersickness data using the Fast Motion Sickness Scale, Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, and galvanic skin response.

However, the virtual content's placement and accessibility depends on the user context. We designed a Context-Aware AR interface that can intelligently adapt for two different contexts: solo and social. We evaluated information access using Context-Aware AR compared to current mobile phones and non-adaptive Glanceable AR interfaces. Our results indicate the advantages of Context-Aware AR interface for information access efficiency, avoiding negative effects on primary tasks or social interactions, and overall user experience.","Shakiba Davari, Feiyu Lu, Doug Bowman",
C1328,HoloLogger: Keystroke Inference on Mixed Reality Head Mounted Displays,,,"When using services in mixed reality (MR) such as online payment and social media, sensitive information must be typed in MR. Keystroke inference attacks have been conducted to hack such information. However, previous attacks require placing extra hardware near the user, which is easily noticeable in practice. In this paper, we expose a more dangerous malware-based attack through the vulnerability that no permission is required for accessing MR motion data. Extensive evaluations of our HoloLogger system demonstrate that the proposed attack is accurate and robust in various environments such as different user positions and input categories.","Shiqing Luo, Xinyu Hu, Zhisheng Yan",

We found that learners struggle to identify infrequent virtual human verbal communication mistakes. Additionally, learners with lower initial trustworthiness ratings are more likely to overlook potentially life-threatening mistakes, and virtual human mistakes temporarily lower learner credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness ratings of virtual humans.","Jacob Stuart, Karen Aul, Anita Stephen, Michael D.

C1336,RedirectedDoors: Redirection While Opening Doors in Virtual Reality,,,"We propose RedirectedDoors, a novel technique for redirection in VR focused on door-opening behavior. This technique manipulates the user's walking direction by rotating the entire virtual environment at a certain angular ratio of the door being opened, while the virtual door's position is kept unmanipulated to ensure door-opening realism. Results of a user study using two types of door-opening interfaces (with and without a passive haptic prop) revealed that the estimated detection thresholds generally showed a higher space efficiency of redirection. Following the results, we derived usage guidelines for our technique that provide lower noticeability and higher acceptability.","Yukai Hoshikawa, Kazuyuki Fujita, Kazuki Takashima, Morten Fjeld, Yoshifumi Kitamura",

We propose a mixed reality rendering method to render glossy and specular reflection effects on metallic virtual objects displayed in the holographic pyramid based on the surrounding real environment at interactive frame rates. Compared with IBL and screen-space ray tracing, our method can generate the rendering results closer to the ground truth at the same time cost.

Here we examined whether eye movements can improve such predictions. Eighteen participants walked through a virtual environment while performing different tasks. The recorded data were used to train an LSTM model. We found that positions 2.5s into the future can be predicted with an average error of 65cm. The benefit of eye movement data depended on task and environment. Situations with changes in walking speed benefited from the inclusion of eye data.","Niklas Stein, Gianni Bremer, Markus Lappe",

Today, these &quot;suitable&quot; visualizations are mostly transferred from desktop to VR without considering their spatial and temporal performance might change in VR. This may not lead to an optimal solution, which can be crucial for precision-based tasks. Misinterpretation of shape or distance in a surgical or pre-operative simulation can affect the chosen treatment and thus directly impact the outcome. Therefore, we evaluate the performance differences of multiple visualizations for 3D surfaces based on their shape and distance estimation for desktop and VR applications.","Jan Niklas Hornbeck, Monique Meuschke, Lennert Zyla, Andr&eacute;-Joel Heuser, Justus Toader, Felix Popp, Christane J.

C1386,The Chaotic Behavior of Redirection - Revisiting Simulations in Redirected Walking,,,"Redirected Walking is a common technique to allow real walking for exploring large virtual environments in constrained physical spaces. Many existing approaches were evaluated in simulation only, and researchers argued that the findings would translate to real scenarios to motivate the effectiveness of their algorithms. In this paper, we argue that simulation-based evaluations require critical reflection. We demonstrate simulations that show the chaotic process fundamental to RDW, in which altering the initial user's position by mere millimeters can drastically change the resulting steering behavior. This insight suggests that redirection is more sensitive to underlying data than previously assumed.","Christian Hirt, Yves Kompis, Christian Holz, Andreas Kunz",

The main challenge is how to generate robust and stealthy projections. For the first time, we formulate this problem as an end-to-end differentiable process and propose Stealthy Projector-based Adversarial Attack (SPAA). In SPAA, we approximate the real Project-and-Capture process using a neural network named PCNet, then we include PCNet in the optimization of projector-based attacks. Finally, we propose an algorithm that alternates between the adversarial loss and stealthiness loss optimization. Experiments show that SPAA clearly outperforms other methods.","Bingyao Huang, Haibin Ling",

Augmented reality windshield displays provide large-content areas supporting drivers in both driving and non-driving related tasks. Participants of a user study were presented with two modes of content presentation (multiple content-specific windows vs. one main window) in a virtual reality driving simulator. Using one main content window resulted in better task performance and lower take-over times, however, subjective user experience was higher for the multi-window user interface.","Andreas Riegler, Andreas Riener, Clemens Holzmann",

With chip-scaled sizes, high refresh rates, and integrated light sources, a large-scale NPA can enable high-resolution real-time holography. One of the critical challenges is the high electrical power consumption required to modulate the amplitude and phase of the pixels. We propose a simple method that outputs a sparse NPA configuration to generate the desired image. Using as few as 10% of dense 2D array pixels, we show, through computational simulations, that a perceptually acceptable holographic image can be generated.

On short timescales of seconds to minutes, we observe no statistically significant relationship between temporal placement of enrollment trajectories and matches to input trajectories. We observe similar median accuracy for users with high and low medium-scale enrollment/input separation of days to weeks. Over long timescales of 7 to 18 months, we obtain optimal performance for short and long enrollment/input separations by using training sets from users providing long-timescale data, as these sets encompass coarse and fine behavior changes.","Robert Miller, Natasha Kholgade Banerjee, Sean Banerjee",

Specifically, this study proposes a new structured light that combines different frequencies of flickers to acquire the correspondence between the image pixels of the event camera and the projector. This method does not rely on the co-axial frame-based measurement and synchronization mechanism between projector and camera and is thus applicable to most general event cameras. Experiments confirm that the proposed method obtains the correspondence robustly with reasonable accuracy in a bright room (up to 2,600 lux) under general indoor lighting and additional light projection.","Yuichiro Fujimoto, Taishi Sawabe, Masayuki Kanbara, Hirokazu Kato",

Existing research has shown SAR predictive cues to further enhance performance. However, this research has been conducted while the user is not fatigued. This paper investigates predictive cues under a sub-optimal scenario by depriving users of sleep. Results from a 62-hour sleep deprivation experiment demonstrate that SAR predictive cues are beneficial to sleep deprived users. From the predictive cues outlined in this paper, the line cue maintained the best performance and was least impacted by early morning performance declines.","Benjamin Volmer, James Baumeister, Linda Grosser, Stewart von Itzstein, Siobhan Banks, Bruce H Thomas",

TimeTables uses multiple space-time cubes on virtual tabletops, which users can manipulate by extracting time layers to create new tabletop views. The system presents information at different time scales by stretching layers to drill down in time. Users can also jump into tabletops to inspect data from an egocentric perspective.

We compensate for the distortion by generating a light source image that cancels the distortions in the mid-air image caused by refraction and reflection. The light source image is generated via ray-tracing simulation by transmitting the desired view image to the mid-air imaging system, and by receiving the transmitted image at the light source position. Finally, we present the results of an evaluation of our method performed in an actual optical system.","Shunji Kiuchi, Naoya Koizumi",

In previous methods, the maximum retargeting is applied only when the hand position aligns with the target position. SAHR generalizes the distance computation to consider the full hand and target geometry. Simulated evaluations demonstrated SAHR can provide improved interaction accuracy over existing methods with full mesh geometry being the most accurate and a primitive approximation being the preferred method for combined computational performance and interaction accuracy.","Brandon J.

The core idea is to replicate the physical characteristics of ascending jumps, and thus we designed two viewpoint manipulation methods: gain manipulation, which differentiates the ascent and descent height&#59; and peak shifting, which delays the peak timing. The experimental results showed that the combination of these methods allowed the participants to feel adequate reality and naturalness of actually jumping onto steps, even knowing no physical steps existed.","Kumpei Ogawa, Kazuyuki Fujita, Kazuki Takashima, Yoshifumi Kitamura",

This paper combines the subtle RDW methods and reset strategy in our method design and proposes a novel solution for RDW. We discretize the representation of possible user positions and orientations by a series of standard poses and rate them based on the possibilities of hitting obstacles of their reachable poses. A transfer path algorithm is proposed to measure the accessibility of the poses. Our method can redirect VR users imperceptibly to the best pose among all the reachable poses.

C1473,Virtual Workspace Positioning Techniques during Teleportation for Co-located Collaboration in Virtual Reality using HMDs,,,"Many co-located collaborative Virtual Reality applications rely on a one-to-one mapping of users' relative positions in real and virtual environments. However, the users' individual virtual navigation may break this spatial configuration. This work enables the recovery of spatial consistency after individual navigation. We provide a virtual representation of the users' shared physical workspace and developed two techniques to position it. The first technique enables a single user to control the virtual workspace location, while the second allows concurrent manipulation. Experimental results show that allowing two users to co-manipulate the virtual workspace significantly reduces negotiation time.","Yiran Zhang, Huyen Nguyen, Nicolas Ladeveze, Cedric Fleury, Patrick Bourdot",

Contrary to this direction, we focus on the weight that the user perceives from AREDs, even though they are virtual and have no physical weight. Our results show evidence that AREDs can be a source of pseudo-weight. We also systematically evaluate the perceived weight changes depending on the layout and delay in the visualization system.","Shohei Mori, Yuta Kataoka, Satoshi Hashiguchi",

We investigated how the visibility of the foot influences penalty shooting in soccer. In a between-group experiment, we asked 28 players to hit eight targets with a virtual ball. We measured the performance, task load, presence, ball control, and body ownership of inexperienced to advanced soccer players. In one condition, the players saw a visual representation of their tracked foot which improved the accuracy of the shots significantly. Players with invisible foot needed 58% more attempts. Further, with foot visibility the self-reported body ownership was higher.","Michael Bonfert, Stella Lemke, Robert Porzel, Rainer Malaka",

To prevent disorientation, the support of spatial updating via other sensory movement cues is necessary. In the presented experiment, participants performed a spatial updating task inside a CAVE, with either no orientation cues, three visible distant landmarks, or one continuous auditory cue present. The data showed improved task performance when an orientation cue was present, with auditory cues providing at least as much improvement as visual cues.","Christiane Breitkreutz, Jennifer Brade, Sven Winkler, Alexandra Bendixen, Philipp Klimant, Georg Jahn",

In the VR game, the two players shoot cannonballs to destroy their opponent's protective wall and cannon, while the programmed floor platform generates vertical vibrations depending on the experimental condition. We concluded that vibration provided to a pair of game players in immersive VR can significantly enhance the VR experience, but sensory symmetry does not guarantee improved gaming performance.","Sungchul Jung, Yuanjie Wu, Ryan Douglas McKee, Robert W.
