In this scenario, it is more important than ever that academic research builds upon best practices and results to amplify impact in the broader field. Open-Source tools are one means to propagate best practice as they lower the barrier to entry for researchers from an engineering point of view, while also embodying the prior work on which the tools were built. Open access tools are also critical to eliminate redundancies and increase world research collaboration in VR. At a time that academic research is growing it also needs to move as fast as the industry, collaboration and shared tools is the best way to do it.  In this workshop, we will gather with creators and users of open-access libraries ranging from avatars (like the Microsoft Rocketbox avatar library) to animation to networking (Ubiq toolkit) to explore how open access tools are helping advance the VR community.",https://discord.com/channels/842181663248482334/951010620260626443

VHCIE,Workshop on Virtual Humans and Crowds in Immersive Environments (VHCIE),"Sunday, March 13",8:00,11:00,NZDT UTC+13,https://files.inria.fr/vhcie/2022,Anne-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Olivier,"Nowadays many tools, including algorithms and systems, are available to create and design believable virtual humans and crowds in immersive virtual environments (IVEs). One traditional research area is thereby the population of IVEs. With sophisticated crowd simulations, environments with the size of an entire city can be efficiently enlivened with thousands of authentic virtual characters, termed virtual agents. Typically, these agents only react to VR users in terms of interactions between walkers, including collision avoidance, gazing, and interpersonal distance constraints. To this end, a second research area focuses on direct agent-user interactions including communicative abilities and social behavior to design believable verbal and non-verbal behavior for agents in face-to-face interactions. Research on both facets has been presented and discussed in the previous VHCIE editions, primarily from the viewpoint of VR research. Thus, VHCIE 2022 widens the focus by starting a cross-community exchange with researchers from industry and other disciplines involved in modeling, developing, and evaluating virtual humans and crowds. </p><p>The objective of VHCIE workshop on &quot;Virtual Humans and Crowds in Immersive Environments&quot; is then threefold. Through a panel and a selection of submitted presentations (short papers and late breaking research), we will: <ol><li> Present state of the art character and crowd animation techniques for interactive agents. Recent developments in character and crowd animations have impressively improved the level of quality for motions, as well as computational performances. One objective of the workshop is to present how VR and immersive environments can benefit from these recent developments.</li><li>Present some examples of new research opportunities offered by the availability of populated virtual environments. Populating VEs with several autonomous characters is a relatively recent advancement. What research can benefit from such capability? We expect presentations related to how recent technological advances enable or facilitate such research. </li><li>Discuss technological requirements for future applications. Recent technologies and software have clearly eased the creation of populated immersive VEs. However, there is still a way for improvement. Thus, the third objective of theworkshop is to gather the requirements of current users of these technologies for future applications. To this end, our audience and an invited cross-community panel from different research areas (VR, IVA, ..) as well as industry will try to answer questions such as: Do users expect better animation quality? Better rendering? Or, higher level of autonomy? What kind of interactivity is expected with autonomous agents?</li></ol>Finally, we expect that the workshop will provide an opportunity for researchers to develop new techniques for virtual humans and crowds and will possibly lead to new intersectoral collaborations.",https://discord.com/channels/842181663248482334/951011444466528288

Extended Reality, which has so far been on the periphery of life, has a chance of becoming an element of everyday life. The arrival of such a world has been accelerated, on the one hand, by technological development and the readiness of IT corporations to invest in VR/XR technology, and on the other hand, by a pandemic that prompted us to look for alternative ways to exist in isolation.</p><p>This situation forces us to face completely new challenges. We must find ways to define ourselves in the virtual world in various dimensions, including establishing social relationships or creating our own identity. We invite you to our online workshop - a space for reflection on issues of social functioning in the world of the Metaverse.

There is neither an in-depth overview of these factors, nor well-founded knowledge on most effects as gained through formal validation. In particular, long-term usage effects are inadequately understood. Meanwhile, mobile platforms and emerging display hardware (&quot;glasses&quot;) promise to ignite the number of users, as well as the system usage duration. To fulfill usability needs, a thorough understanding of perceptual and intertwined cognitive factors is highly needed by both research and industry: issues such as depth misinterpretation, object relationship mismatches and information overload can severely limit usability of applications, or even pose risks in their usage. Based on the gained knowledge, for example, new interactive visualization and view management techniques can be iteratively defined, developed and validated, optimized to be congruent with human capabilities and limitations in route to more usable application interfaces.",https://discord.com/channels/842181663248482334/951011850731024385
