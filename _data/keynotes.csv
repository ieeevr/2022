keynote-debevec,Paul Debevec,USC ICT and Netflix,"Light Fields, Light Stages, and the Future of Virtual Production",TBD,,,,"I'll describe recent work at Netflix, Google, and the USC Institute for Creative Technologies to bridge real and virtual worlds through photography, lighting, and machine learning.  I'll begin by describing Welcome to Light Fields, the first downloadable Virtual Reality light field experience.  I'll then describe DeepView, Google's solution for Light Field Video, providing immersive VR video you can move around in after it's been recorded, with subjects close enough to be within arm's reach. I'll also present how Google's new Light Stage system paired with Machine Learning techniques is enabling new techniques for lighting estimation from faces for AR and interactive portrait relighting on mobile phone hardware.  I will finally talk about how all of these techniques may enable the next generation of virtual production filmmaking, infusing both light fields and relighting into the real-world image-based lighting LED stages now revolutionizing how movies and television are made.","Paul Debevec is Netflix's Director of Research, Creative Algorithms and Technology overseeing the creation of new technologies in computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning for virtual production, visual effects, and animation. His 2002 Light Stage 3 system at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies was the first to surround actors with color LED lighting driven by images of virtual locations for virtual production. Techniques from Paul's work have been used to create key visual effects sequences in The Matrix, Spider-Man 2, Benjamin Button, Avatar, Gravity, Furious 7, Blade Runner: 2049, Gemini Man, Free Guy, numerous video games, and to record a 3D Portrait of US President Barack Obama. His light stage facial capture technology has helped numerous companies create photoreal digital actors and build machine learning datasets for synthetic avatars.  Paul's work in HDR imaging, image-based lighting, and light stage facial capture has been recognized with two technical Academy Awards and SMPTE's Progress Medal. Paul is a Fellow of the Visual Effects Society and a member of the Television Academy's Science and Technology Peer Group, and has served on the Motion Picture Academy's Visual Effects Branch Executive Committee and Science and Technology Council, and as Vice President of ACM SIGGRAPH.
