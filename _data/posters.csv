DC1031,DC,Designing and Optimizing Daily-wear Photophobic Smart Sunglasses,Xiaodan Hu,"Photophobia, also known as light sensitivity, is a condition in which there is a fear of light. Traditional sunglasses and tinted glasses typically worn by individuals with photophobia only provide linear dimming, leading to difficulty to see the contents in the dark region of a high-contrast environment (e.g., indoors at night). This paper presents a smart dimming sunglass that uses a spatial light modular (SLM) to flexibly dim the user's field of view based on scene detection from an HDR camera. To address the problem when the user views a distant object, the occlusion mask displayed on the SLM becomes blurred due to out-of-focus, thus providing an insufficient modulation. An optimization model is designed to dilate the occlusion mask appropriately. The optimized dimming effect is verified by the camera and preliminary test by real users to be able to filter the desired amount of incoming light through a blurred mask.",,Expo Hall A,D25,A

DC1023,DC,Gamified VR for Socially Isolated Adolescents with Significant Illness,Ms Udapola Balage Hansi Shashiprabha Udapola,"Adolescents with significant illness face various psychosocial and mental wellbeing challenges during hospitalisation. Social isolation from family and peers is identified as a significant concern for this group. Several digital interventions have been proposed to connect these young people with others, such as video conferencing, social media, social robots, and online games. Research so far has found those to be beneficial for adolescents' wellbeing. Social VR is a novel social interaction mechanism that allows users to interact socially within an immersive 3D virtual environment with embodiment experience. Playing in the social VR space is generally identified as a motivational factor for adolescents to engage in social interactions. Therefore, integrating game technologies into social VR space would encourage and motivate socially isolated adolescents to engage socially intrinsically. The main goal of this research project is to enhance the social engagement of socially isolated adolescents by fostering positive interactions with their peers within a safe gamified virtual environment. In order to achieve that, this research will design and develop an intervention using game and VR technologies. Then, the designed intervention will be evaluated with the target user group to investigate the impact of implemented game mechanics on social engagement and connectedness.",,Expo Hall B,D25,B

An electrophysiologist clinically performs the procedure that involves navigating 'catheters' into the chambers of the heart through peripheral blood vessels, studying the cardiac electrophysiology and performing ablations. An electrophysiologist must possess a comprehensive understanding of cardiac electrophysiology and precise instrument handling due to the sensitiveness of the procedure. In the conventional approach, electroanatomical mapping systems and fluoroscopic visualizations are utilized to assist the procedure&#59; however, their limitations reduce the procedure's effectiveness.

In such spaces comfort and productivity could be decreased due to hardware limitations like small screen sizes or input devices and environmental clutter. Mixed reality (MR) has the potential to solve such issues. It can provide the user with additional display space that can even include the third dimension. It can open up new possibilities for interacting with virtual content using gestures or spatially tracked devices.

The potentials of virtual characters' emotion richness is understudied and it is unclear how the facial expressions affect the individuals differently in the virtual environment. Therefore, we will focus on understanding people's behavioural, physiological, and psychological reactions toward facial-animated characters in VR experimental studies. The first study examines whether particular non-verbal behaviours can enhance people's therapy engagement, by applying warmness facial expressions and head nod on a virtual coach. Future experiments will further look at mixed facial expressions, and assess people's visual attention (through eye-tracking) and interpretation of the emotional faces.

DC1000,DC,Robust Redirected Walking in the Wild,Niall L. Williams,"Locomotion is a fundamental component of experiences in virtual reality (VR). However, locomotion in VR is often difficult because the layouts of the physical and virtual environments are often different, which may cause unobstructed paths in the virtual world to correspond to obstructed paths in the physical world. Thus, in order to deliver a comfortable and immersive virtual experience to users, it is important that the user can explore the virtual world using techniques that help them avoid collisions with unseen physical objects. Redirected walking (RDW) is one such technique that enables collision-free locomotion in VR using real walking. Although RDW shows promise as an effective locomotion interface, it has seen relatively little adoption in the consumer market due to the difficulty in deploying effective RDW algorithms that are robust to different environment layouts and different users' perceptual thresholds. For my thesis, I am focused on developing RDW methods that are capable of enabling collision-free locomotion in arbitrary physical and virtual environments for a wide range of users.",,Expo Hall B,D27,B

The optimal interface, that is the most efficient yet least intrusive, in one context may be the worst interface for another context.

DC1047,DC,Improving presence of virtual humans through paralinguistics,Andrew H Maxim,"Social presence and plausibility are two of the most important constructs being studied in IEEE VR to improve user experience in virtual environments. However, virtual humans that are used in these virtual environments lack the capability of adaptive speech that directly influences social presence and plausibility of the virtual humans that are used since humans use adaptive speech during conversations. Virtual humans lack the adaptability of their speech in the manner that humans do. Research has been explored in how pitch, rate of speech, and intensity can be manipulated in human discourse. However, little research has been done in using adaptable speech to affect dialog with virtual humans. This dissertation attempts to create a framework and a system that enables adaptive virtual human speech. This includes using machine learning and user modeling to manipulate paralinguistic features such as pitch, rate of speech, pause duration, and intensity using Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). Understanding the interplay of paralinguistic features between virtual human and human will improve the social presence of virtual humans.
