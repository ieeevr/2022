    <h1> About the IEEE VR Conference </h1>
    <p>
        The IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR) is the premier international event for the presentation of research results in the broad areas of virtual, 
        augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/XR). Since 1993, IEEE VR has presented groundbreaking research and accomplishments by virtual reality pioneers: scientists, engineers, designers, 
        and artists, paving the way for the future. Soon, IEEE VR expanded its scope to also include augmented, mixed, and other forms of mediated reality. Similarly, the IEEE Symposium
        on 3D User Interfaces (3DUI), which started as a workshop at IEEE VR in 2004, has become the premier venue for 3D user interfaces and 3D interaction in virtual environments. 
        In 2018, VR and 3DUI were merged into the IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces, with the short name IEEE VR. In 2020, VR was the first major IEEE 
        conference to be held entirely online and in a virtual environment.

    <h1> About Christchurch, New Zealand </h1>
    <p>
        Christchurch is the city of exploration, a refreshing urban centre full of new secrets to discover. The city has been through 
        some massive changes in the past few years, and the time has come to explore it all. Christchurch has a vibrant art and 
        technology scene while also serving as a gateway to New Zealand's South Island with all its natural wonders and attractions.
    </p>
    <p>
        IEEE VR 2022 may be virtual now, but we hope to welcome you all to Christchurch one day soon.
