    <h1>Come and Join Us</h1>

    <!--    
    <p>
        Present your latest and greatest work at IEEE VR 2021. We are planning for VR 2021 to occur in both physical and virtual spaces.  The physical conference will be held at the <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">Instituto Superior Técnico</a>, one mile from the Lisbon airport, superbly located in downtown Lisbon. The sunniest European capital, Lisbon is one of the world’s most ancient cities, with a very rich history. Our goal is for IEEE VR 2021 to combine the best of traditional face-to-face meetings, while following the historical footsteps of the Virtual Experience of VR 2020 in Atlanta. The conference will take place from 27 of March to April 3rd, during Easter break.  Come join us for an unforgettable experience and explore the virtuality continuum in the premier event covering extended reality, featuring oral presentations, posters, research demos, tutorials, and workshops.

        Present your latest and greatest work at IEEE VR 2022 in <b>Christchurch, New Zealand</b>. This will be the first time that IEEE VR is held not only in 
        Australasia but in the entire Southern Hemisphere. Christchurch is one of the main centres in New 
        Zealand and the largest city of and gateway to New Zealand's South Island. The New York Times named Christchurch one of 52
        places to visit in 2020 as it stands out as a global symbol of resilience. In recent years it has been completely redeveloped, 
        resulting in the construction of <a href="https://www.tepae.co.nz/">Te Pae</a>, the new conference centre where we will hold 
        the conference from 12<sup>th</sup>-16<sup>th</sup> March 2022.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are actively monitoring the COVID-19 situation to determine if the in-person IEEE VR experience will be both safe and 
        feasible due to internation travel restrictions. We expect that these restrictions will permit you to join the conference 
        in person. In addition to this, the conference will be a hybrid event. Our goal is for IEEE VR 2022 to provide the best 
        experience for both in-person and virtual attendees, following in the historical footsteps of the Virtual Experience of 
        the Virtual Experience of <a href="https://ieeevr.org/2020/">VR 2020 in Atlanta</a> and 
        <a href="https://ieeevr.org/2021/">VR 2021 in Lisbon</a>. Come join us for an unforgettable experience and explore the 
        virtuality continuum in the premier event covering extended reality featuring oral presentations, posters, research demos, 
        tutorials, and workshops.
